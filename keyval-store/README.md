# Key-Value Store with Configurable Consistency

## Files and Directories
* `keyval.thrift` Thrift IDL file for Key-Value Store operations and data-types
* `res/` Project resources and links
* `py/` Python code for the project. All Python code that depend on our Thrift file definitions must be run from this directory
* `py/gen-py` Python code generated by the Thrift compiler using our `keyval.thrift` IDL file

## Compile and Run Code
First, `cd` into the `py/` directory. All Python code must be run from the `py/` directory, since this is where the `keyval.thrift` code was compiled and placed into the `gen-py` directory.

To start the replica nodes, run:
```
./run-nodes.py
```
This will start 4 replica nodes at random ports and initalize the `node_list`, which contains information of all nodes, for each replica node. After initialization, each node will start listening to their port.

You can also manually start a replica node by running:
```
./server.sh <port #>
```
Where `<port #>` is the port number that the node should listen at.

Once the nodes are listening to their port, run the client by typing:
```
./client.sh <ip> <port>
```
Where `<ip>` is the IP address of one of the replica nodes and `<port #>` is the port number of the same replica node.
